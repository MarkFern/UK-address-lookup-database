					<strike>The above is not strictly true (I have realised) because some of the OGL data has the following caveat:</strike>
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight:bold;margin-left: 30px;">
					<strike>THE MATERIAL NEEDS TO BE  "..REPRODUCED ACCURATELY AND NOT USED IN A MISLEADING CONTEXT."</strike>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strike>Have sent email to see whether I can do away with the first part above. It's looking unlikely that a fraudulence condition for the second part can be added to the re-licensing because CC BY-SA 3.0 doesn't allow restraints to be added to the CC licence in re-licencing of works under the licence.</strike>
				</p>				
				<p>
					<strike>Sent emails to psi@nationalarchives.gsi.gov.uk and census@nisra.gov.uk at least about a week and a half ago from today (today is 14.2.2020). The email to the National Archives domain bounced back. The other one didn't but still no reply.</strike>
				<BR><BR>
					<strike>This issue is a bit irritating really. Probably the "..reproduced accurately and not used in a misleading context" text was meant to apply in respect of excerpts and the like. My use of the data isn't of that nature, so probably they won't mind my ignoring the text. I will probably give them another call about this issue.</strike>

				<p>
					<span style="color:lime;">PROBLEM NOW RESOLVED. NISRA has said I can use the OGL licence with no further conditions&mdash;great!</span>

					The legal code for the <A HREF="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode">CC BY-SA 3.0</A> still needs to be read in full. The human-readable deed has been found to be lacking.
				</p>
				<p>
					In particular, notices for warranty disclaimers issued by original licencors must be included on this webpage. This has now (14.2.2020) been fulfilled, so don't need to worry about this requirement anymore. However, there are now new issues concerning providing sufficient author attribution for the many Wikipedia and Wikishire pages I used. Feels like a nightmare.
				</p>
				<BR><HR><BR>
				<p>
					26.2.2020<BR><BR>
					Have had issues with complying with the terms of CC BY-SA 3.0 licence. The first part of these issues, are discussed <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Reusing_Wikipedia_content#CC_BY-SA_3.0_licence_requirements_for_credits_in_adaptations/collections_that_also_has_credits_for_other_non-CC_works">here</A>.
				</p>				
				<p>
					To address the first part of these issues, I've decided to download all the lists of contributors for every used page that is mentioned in the section dedicated to the material licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0. Then with those lists, I'll insert them into the section just mentioned, with the lists organised so that each list is displayed with the page for which the list is the contributor list.
					Each contributor name in these lists, will also be a hyperlink to the Wikipedia user page for the contributor. This decision for addressing the first part of these issues, should provide sufficient 
					credit, with the required level of prominence, with respect to complying with the CC BY-SA 3.0 licence. By following through with this decision, the first part of these issues will be completely addressed.<BR>
					<BR>

						<B>Example illustrating procedure to be used to get contributor lists at least for Wikipedia material (a similar procedure might also exist for Wikishire material)</B><BR><BR>				
						<div style="margin-left: 30px;margin-top:0px;padding-top:0px">
							To get the list of contributers to the Wikipedia Scotland page, first run:<BR>

							Then keep on running :<BR>
							<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=contributors&titles=Scotland&pclimit=500&pccontinue=??????</pre>
							where ?????? is the pccontinue value returned by the previous GET request, until no pccontinue value is returned (also an empty batchcomplete value will also likely be returned at such time).<BR><BR>

							Unix command `wget` can be used for running the URLs and downloading the responses, but characters will have to be escaped accordingly.<BR>
							<BR><BR>
							On 27.2.2020, a script was created to retrieve such a contributor list for any particular Wikipedia title. The script was stored in the GitHub repository at <A HREF="https://github.com/MarkFern/UK-address-lookup-database/blob/master/scripts/for_generating_Legal_Notice/GetListOfContributorsForWikipediaTitle.sh">this location</A>.

					The second part of these issues relates to a mistake I made when adding the URLs for the CC BY-SA 3.0 credits. Some of the URLs I added (especially for certain Northern Ireland data), were erroneously the URLs for Wikipedia search results. I should instead have added the URLs of proper Wikipedia pages, as such search results merely compile snippets from proper Wikipedia pages (when there are search results). The search results aren't as such, seemingly, licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 as a singular work, or at least, it's not clear exactly how such search results are licensed. Anyway, to address and remedy the second part of these issues, what I've done now is to go through all the search result URLs, and pick out "proper Wikipedia page" URLs that appear may have been used or could have been used for the related database data. These picked out URLs, now have been added to this licence statement (it took about half a day to do). Whilst it's not perfect, I think it's enough. It has to be remembered that more delays in the release of this database, deprives more the wider community of the benefit of it.
					
				</p>
				<BR><HR><BR>
				<p>
					For GPLv3 licence to apply, we probably need to include on this web-page:
					<ul>
						<li>information telling users of the database that there is no warranty for the database,</li>
						<li>information stating that licensees may convey the database under the GPLv3 licence, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-style:italic;">AND</span></li>
						<li>information on how to view a copy of the GPLv3 licence</li>
					</ul>
					(as well as perhaps other things).
				</p><BR>		
				<p>
					I will be a GPLv3 licencor but not a GPLv3 licencee in relation to establishing the GitHub repo.
				</p><BR>
				<p>
					So long as the database has no interactive user interface, we don't need to worry about the GPLv3 requirement for such interfaces to display “...'Appropriate Legal Notices'...” .
				</p><BR>
				<p>
					The following excerpt from the Creative Commons webpage on compatibility needs to be processed, and <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:underline;"><B>especially the last three links in the excerpt need to be processed</B></SPAN>:
					<div style="margin-left: 30px;font-style:italic;margin-top:0px;padding-top:0px">
						<b>GPLv3:</b> The GNU <A HREF="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public License version 3</A> was declared a “BY-SA–Compatible License” for version 4.0 on 8 October 2015. Note that compatibility with the GPLv3 is one-way only, which means you may license your contributions to adaptations of BY-SA 4.0 materials under GPLv3, but you may not license your contributions to adaptations of GPLv3 projects under BY-SA 4.0.

					The following GPLv3 excerpt is interesting; it suggests that I can't add obligations to the GPL for the sake of the CC licence, thereby seemingly negating the possibility that to comply with CC, extra obligations will have to be added on top of the GPL licence (of concern in relation to users opting to use database under the GPL licence rather than the CC one):
					<div style="margin-left: 30px;font-style:italic;margin-top:0px;padding-top:0px">
						“You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.”

					For licencing under GPLv3, the following notice should appear in every source file, ideally at the beginning of each source file:
					<div style="margin-left: 30px;font-style:italic;margin-top:0px;padding-top:0px">

					Also for GPLv2, information should be provided on how to contact Mark Fernandes by paper mail and also by electronic mail.
					<BR><BR>
					 If the program does terminal interaction, or has a GUI interface, there are further requirements for GPLv3 licencing mentioned in the "How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs" section after the end of the terms.
					<BR><BR>
					 If the supplier of the database produced the database under employment, or in the setting of a school, there are other potential requirements again mentioned in the "How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs" section.
					<BR><BR>
					 On 7.2.2020, Mark finished reviewing all of his notes generated from previously processing the GPLv3 licence. So long as the database is released in 'source code' form, a copy of the GPLv3 licence accompanies the 'source code', and compliance is made with the notes in red ink at the beginning of this webpage, no more reviewing of the GPLv3 licence is needed.

						The StreetNames table makes use of street name abbreviations that were detailed at the internet address located <A HREF="https://wiki.waze.com/wiki/United_Kingdom/Roads#Abbreviations">here</A> on 7th September 2019.

											The author of the tool has said that the tool output is not part of the copyright of the program, and no terms are imposed on simply using the program. The tool output was generated by transforming the ETRS89 Geodetic coordinates for entries in the OS Northern Ireland (NI) Open Data Placename Gazetteer product, to OSGB36 (cartesian) coordinates. The output was then plugged into the Wikishire lookup tool to correspond the places in the gazetteer product to the historic counties of Northern Ireland. The correspondence between the place names in the gazetteer and the historic counties discovered for these places, is what is stored in the data (output coordinates are not stored).
